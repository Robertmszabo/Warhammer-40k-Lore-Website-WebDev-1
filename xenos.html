     <h3>Summary</h3>
     <p>
        The Aeldari are one of the oldest races in the galaxy, with a history spanning millions of years. They were once a thriving, 
        powerful, and decadent civilization known for their unparalleled psychic abilities and technological prowess. 
        <br/> Their society reached its peak during the time of the Eldar Empire. However, their decadence and hedonism led to the birth of the Chaos God Slaanesh,
        resulting in a cataclysmic event known as the Fall. 
        This event shattered their civilization and led to the near-extinction of their species.
        <br/>After the Fall, some Aeldari survivors fled aboard enormous spacecraft called Craftworlds. 
        These Craftworlds are self-sustaining, mobile city-ships 
        that house the remnants of Aeldari society. Each Craftworld has its own distinct culture and beliefs.
        <br/>The Aeldari are a multifaceted and deeply lore-rich race in the Warhammer 40,000 universe. Their ancient history, 
        psychic abilities, and the consequences of their past actions make them a compelling and tragic element of the setting.

     </div>
     <h3>Summary</h3>
     <p>
        The Necrons are an enigmatic and ancient race in the Warhammer 40,000 universe known for their advanced technology,
         tomb worlds, and quest for galactic dominance. 
        <br/>The Necrons were once an advanced and powerful humanoid species known as the Necrontyr. However, they were plagued by short 
        lifespans due to radiation from their dying sun. Desperate for immortality, they made a pact with the malevolent C'tan, star gods 
        who offered them eternal life in exchange for servitude.
        <br/>The C'tan transformed the Necrontyr into immortal, mechanical beings, sacrificing their souls and emotions in the process. 
        The Necrons' consciousness was transferred into metal bodies called "Necrodermis."
        The Necrons are virtually immortal, and their bodies can regenerate from almost any damage. This makes them incredibly resilient 
        and difficult to defeat.
        <br/>The Necrons are a mysterious and formidable race in the Warhammer 40,000 lore. Their quest to reclaim their empire and their 
        advanced technology make them a formidable adversary in the grim and dark future of the 41st millennium.

     </div>
     <h3>Summary</h3>
     <p>
        The Tyranids are a relentless and highly adaptable alien race in the Warhammer 40,000 
        universe known for their insatiable hunger and overwhelming numbers. 
        <br/>The Tyranids are a collective, bio-engineered hive species from outside the Milky Way galaxy. 
        They operate as a vast, interconnected swarm driven by a single purpose: to consume all organic matter in their path.
        <br/>The Tyranids are controlled by a gestalt consciousness known as the Hive Mind. This Hive Mind links all Tyranids 
        together, allowing for instantaneous communication and coordination across the entire species.
        Tyranids consume entire planets, stripping them of all organic life and resources. This consumption 
        process is known as "biomass harvesting," and it fuels their relentless expansion.
        <br/>The Tyranids are a relentless and nightmarish threat in the grim future of Warhammer 40,000, serving as a symbol 
        of the inexorable and inscrutable forces that lurk in the galaxy. 
        Their unending hunger and adaptability make them one of the most feared races in the 41st millennium.
